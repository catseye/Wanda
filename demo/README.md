wanda.lua demo
==============

This directory contains a demonstration of running `wanda.lua` in a
web browser, under [Fengari][].

In order to for this demonstration to work locally, you'll need
to run a local webserver from the *root* directory of this
repository.  For example, if you have Python installed,

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then open

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/wanda.html

in your web browser.  If you don't have Python, other options
(and more information on running web installations locally)
can be found here: [how to run things locally][].
